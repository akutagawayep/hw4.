    <p class="text">Genhin impact is a computer game with an open world and RPG elements by the chinese company <a href="https://www.hoyoverse.com/ru-ru">HoYoverse</a>.
        Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
  Development began in 2017 and is currently ongoing. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and open-world immersiveness, but criticized its simplistic endgame and monetization model. A commercial success, the game grossed more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest ever first-year launch revenue for any video game. It has grossed more than $4 billion worldwide, as of March 2022.</p>
